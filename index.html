        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3><i>(1984-Present)</i></h3>
        <p class="widthp">The Guerrilla Girls are feminist activist artists. They wear gorilla masks in public and use facts, humor and outrageous visuals to expose gender and ethnic bias as well as corruption in politics, art, film, and pop culture. Their anonymity keeps the focus on the issues, and away from who they might be: they could be anyone and they are everywhere. They also believe in an intersectional feminism that fights discrimination and supports human rights for all people and all genders. The group together undermine the idea of a mainstream narrative by revealing the understory, the subtext, the overlooked, and the downright unfair. They have done hundreds of projects (posters, actions, books, videos, stickers) all over the world.</p>
        <p class="widthp">The Guerrilla Girls also holds interventions and exhibitions at museums, blasting them on their own walls for their bad behavior and discriminatory practices, including their 2015 stealth projection on the façade of the Whitney Museum about income inequality and the super rich hijacking art. Their retrospectives in Bilbao and Madrid, and their US traveling exhibition, Guerrilla Girls: Not Ready To Make Nice, have attracted thousands. Recently they produced new street and museum projects at Tate Modern and Whitechapel Gallery, London; São Paulo Museum of Art; Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam; Museum of Military History, Dresden; Art Basel Hong Kong; and many other places.</p>

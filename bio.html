            <h3><u>Two main events inspired the formation of the Guerrilla Girls:</u></h3>
                  <p class="biotxt"> One was the publication of the influential feminist essay "Why have there been no great women
                  artists?" in 1971 by art historian Linda Nochlin. As the title suggests, Nochlin accepts
                  that throughout history, women have failed to achieve greatness on a par with the
                  Michelangelos and Picassos of the art world.  Nochlin blames the art world, eschewing
                  the oft-repeated explanation that women must be somehow biologically or intellectually
                  inferior. </P>

                  <p>The second event occurred in 1984 when only 13 out of 169 contemporary artists
                  invited to display work at the Museum of Modern Art's International Survey of Recent
                  Painting and Sculpture were women.</P>

          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-6 row">
          <h4 class="biotxt"><u>The Group's Most Iconic Poster</u></h4>
              <p class=" biotext">The Guerrilla Girls' first color poster, which remained the group's most iconic image, is the 1989 Metropolitan Museum poster, which used data from the group's first "weenie count. "Next to the text is an imageof the Jean Auguste
              Dominique Ingrespiece La Grande Odalisque, one of the most famous female nudes
              in Western art history, with a gorilla head placed over the original face.</p>

          <h4 class="biotxt"><u>The Goal of the Guerrillas</u></h4>

            <p>The idea to adopt the gorilla as the group's symbol stemmed from a spelling
            error. One of the first Guerrilla Girls accidentally spelled the group's name at a meeting
            as "gorilla". Despite the fact that the idea of using a gorilla as a group symbol might
            have been accidental, the choice is nevertheless pertinent to the group's overall
            message in several key ways.<p>

            <p>Though this goal has never been explicitly stated by the group, in the history of Western art, primates have often been associated with the visual arts, and with the figure of the artist. The idea of ars simia naturae ("art the ape of nature") maintains that
            the job of art is to "ape", or faithfully represent nature. . This was an idea first
            popularized by Renaissance thinker Giovanni Boccaccio who alleged that "the artist in
            imitating nature only follows Nature's own command.To begin with, the gorilla in popular culture and media is often associated with King Kong or other images of trapped and tamed apes. The gorilla is also typically associated with masculinity. The Met Museum poster is in part shocking because of its juxtaposition of the eroticized female odalisque body, and the large,
            snarling gorilla head.</p>
